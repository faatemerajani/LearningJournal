# hello-world

I've had a gist and a commit to another project so far...



Trying a few things from Markdown Markup syntax(** and i hadn't even heard about this**
well here we are again...\(0_0)/
oh we have emojies thanks to Markdown :pizza: 🍸
preview changes then 😄
adding more than one author...later!
why won't it go to the next line tho?
